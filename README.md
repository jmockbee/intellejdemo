I wanted to save my repos on git hub to show progress 

### These are the instructions 
 VCS at top  enable version control integration (means git init)
          choose git and then ok at bottom bring up version control bottom left  hand corner
         
          will see files in unversioned files
         
         under project and intellejdemo
          
         create file for git.ignore
          
         create .gitignore file put .idea and *iml. file in it
         
          ctrl+a means select all
         
          then right click and commit changes
         
          uncheck perform code analysis may hinder your commit
         
          then create repository on git
         
          go to vcs tool bar to git and remote
         
          add origin url
         
          go to vcs and to git, push
         
          should get message successful push
         
          System.out.println("the steps to adding to git repo");
         
          look in version control window see one file changed then right click
